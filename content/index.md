Hey there! I’m Bobby Lin — a software engineer who loves bringing ideas to life with code. 

Right now, I’m deep into web development, but I’m also diving into app development, backend engineering, and exploring the wild world of Web3. 

You’ll find some of my latest experiments and projects over on the [Projects page](/projects).
Beyond coding, I also share bits of my weekly life in the Weekly Reports section, and occasionally post articles — sometimes about programming, sometimes about books or movies I’ve enjoyed. 

Feel free to leave a comment or reach out; I’d love to hear from you.

I’m always open to remote opportunities and new collaborations. Based in Shanghai, and if you’re around, let’s grab a coffee and geek out over code!

You can find me on [X](https://x.com/bobbylin23) and [Github](https://www.github.com/bobbylin23).
